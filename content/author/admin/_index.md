I am a doctoral student in the [Laboratory for the Study of Upper Airway Dysfunction] (https://www.tc.columbia.edu/uadlab/) at Columbia University. My research interests include the rehabilitation of swallowing and cough dysfunction. As a clinically trained speech pathologist, I am also interested in the translation of research into clinical practice.
