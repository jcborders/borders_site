# Abstract.
abstract = "*Purpose*: Voluntary cough dysfunction is highly prevalent across multiple patient populations. Voluntary cough has been utilized as a screening tool for swallowing safety deficits and as a target for compensatory and exercise-based dysphagia management. However, it remains unclear whether voluntary cough dysfunction is associated with the ability to effectively clear the airway. <br><br> *Methods*: Individuals with neurodegenerative disorders performed same-day voluntary cough testing and flexible endoscopic evaluations of swallowing (FEES). Participants who were cued to cough after exhibiting penetration to the vocal folds and/or aspiration with thin liquids during FEES met inclusion criteria. One-hundred and twenty-three trials were blinded and the amount of residue before and after a cued cough on FEES was measured with a visual analog scale. Linear and binomial mixed effects models examined the relationship between cough airflow during voluntary cough testing and the proportion of residue expelled.  <br><br> *Results*: Peak expiratory flow rate (*p* = .004) and cough expired volume from the entire epoch (*p* = .029) were significantly associated with the proportion of aspiration expelled from the subglottis. Peak expiratory flow rate values of 3.00 L/s, 3.50 L/s and 5.30 L/s provided high predicted probabilities that ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 80% aspirate was expelled. Accounting for depth of aspiration significantly improved model fit (*p* < .001).    <br><br> *Conclusions*: These findings suggest that voluntary cough airflow is associated with cough effectiveness to clear aspiration from the subglottis, though aspiration amount and depth may play an important role in this relationship. These findings provide further support for the clinical utility of voluntary cough in the management of dysphagia."
