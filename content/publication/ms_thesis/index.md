# Abstract.
abstract = "The present study examined developmental differences in feedback processing of declarative learning between children and young adults using event-related potentials (ERPs). A visual feedback-based two-choice paired associate learning task was utilized, which required participants to learn associations between visually presented non-objects. Though children and adults demonstrated similar learning outcomes at comparable rates, children exhibited distinct patterns of feedback processing. Temporal Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized to examine two feedback related ERP components, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the fronto-central positivity (FCP). Neurophysiologically, the amplitude of the FRN following negative feedback was not different between children and adults in the initial stage of learning. Additionally, children did not demonstrate the learning-related decrease in the FRN amplitude to positive feedback seen in adults. The FCP amplitude was found to be overall larger in adults when compared with children. Moreover, a learning-related increase in the FCP elicited by negative feedback was found in adults but not in children. Taken together, these findings propose that although children and adults demonstrate similar learning outcomes, children exhibit different electrophysiological patterns in the FRN and FCP that reflect differences in the processing of feedback in a declarative learning task."
